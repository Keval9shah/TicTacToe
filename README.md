# TicTacToe
GUI(JavaFX) App


in fxml(sample.fxml) in first anchorpane there are two buttons to
choose from X or O. & when button is pressed a integer
variable named "xoro" is given value 1 or 0 respectively
but as soon as new fxml(sampple.fxml) is loaded the value of
xoro is changed back to -1(initialized value)


WHY???
& How to fix this???
How to pass value from one fxml anchorpane to another??
